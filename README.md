# Scalable deployment of cloud infrastructures for developing and processing Deep Learning models

  This repository will contain the code used in my thesis project. 

# [Infrastructure Manager](http://www.grycap.upv.es/im/)

  This repository contains the RADL files required to deploy the whole architecture.

# [Ansible Roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)

  The Ansible Roles that are used during deployment:

## [Hadoop File System](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html)
